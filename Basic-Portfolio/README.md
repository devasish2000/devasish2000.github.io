# Basic-Portfolio

This is a template for a basic portfolio website.
So far the site is static, built with HTML and CSS files.

Check out [this staged version](https://mysterious-brushlands-16203.herokuapp.com/index.html).

Feel free to fork and re-use:

`git clone https://github.com/Meggin/Basic-Portfolio.git`

## A word of caution

I'm learning the fundamentals of writing CSS,
so you will notice I'm not using [flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) yet.
It's good to learn floats and positioning first.

Also, the site isn't responsive yet.
It will be, just not yet.

Stay tuned, as I hopefully learn to write better CSS!

## About design decisions

This template is based on an assignment in the [Berkeley Coding Bootcamp](https://codingbootcamp.berkeley.edu).
One of the design requirements was to maximize the size of the site at 960px.

I made a design decision to increase that size to 1200px,
to give the boxes in the pages more visual space.
(These boxes also had size requirements,
so either they would get smaller, or the rest of the page bigger.)
Hope this is OK.
